<p>神探夏洛克第一季第一集原剧对白听写</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How's your blog going?<br>
</li>
<li>You haven't written a word, have you?</li>
<li>You just wrote "still have trust issues".</li>
<li>And you read my writing upside down.</li>
<li>You see what I mean?</li>
<li>John, you're a soldier.</li>
<li>It's gonna take you a while to adjust to civilian life.</li>
<li>And write a blog about everything that happens to you, will honestly help you.</li>
<li>Nothing happens to me.</li>
<li>My husband, was a happy man who lived life to the full.</li>
<li>He loved his family and his work.</li>
<li>And he shouldn't have taken his own life in this way.</li>
<li>is a mystery and shock to all who knew him.</li>
<li>The body of Beth, <strong>Junior Minister for Transport</strong> was found late last night on the building site in Greater London.</li>
<li>Preliminary investigation suggests that this was suicide.</li>
<li>We can confirm this apparent suicide closely resembles those of .. and ..</li>
<li><strong>In the light of this</strong>, these incidents are now being treated as linked.</li>
<li>The investigation is ongoing.</li>
<li>But the <strong>detective inspector</strong> Lestrade will take questions now.</li>
<li>How can suicide be linked?</li>
<li>Well, they all took the same poison.</li>
<li>They were all found in places that they had no reason to be.</li>
<li>None of them had shown any prior indication.</li>
<li>But you can't have serial suicides.</li>
<li>Well, <strong>apparently</strong> you can.</li>
<li>The three people, there's nothing that links them?</li>
<li>There's no link we've found yet.</li>
<li>We're looking for it, there has to be be one.</li>
<li>If you've all got texts, please ignore them.</li>
<li>If there no more questions for detective inspector Lestrade, I'm goin to bring this <strong>session</strong> to an end.</li>
<li>If they're suicide, what are you investigating?</li>
<li>As I say, these suicides are clearly linked.</li>
<li>It's an unusual situation, we've got the best people investigating.</li>
<li>One more question, is there any chance these are murders.</li>
<li>And if they are, is this the work of a serial killer?</li>
<li>I know that you like writing about these, but these do <strong>appear to be</strong> suicides.</li>
<li>We know the difference.</li>
<li>The poison was clearly self-<strong>administered</strong>(执行).</li>
<li>Ok, if they aren't murders, how do people keep themselves safe?</li>
<li>Oh, don't commit suicide.</li>
<li>Obviously, this is a frightening time for people, but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions.</li>
<li>We're all as safe as we wanna be.<br>
</li>
<li>You've got to stop him doing that. He's making us look like idiots.</li>
<li>If you can tell me how he does it, I'll stop him.</li>
<li>John, John Watson</li>
<li>We're at Barts together.</li>
<li>I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at.</li>
<li>I got shot.</li>
<li>Are you still at Barts then?</li>
<li>Teaching now. Yeah, bright young things like we used to be. God, I hate them.</li>
<li>What about you, just staying in town till you get yourself sorted.</li>
<li>I can't afford London on my Army <strong>pension(抚恤金)</strong>.</li>
<li>You can't bear to be anywhere else. That's not the John Watson I know.</li>
<li>I'm not the John Watson.</li>
<li>Couldn't Harry help?</li>
<li>Yeah, like that's gonna happen.</li>
<li>I don't know, get a flatshare or something?(md的拼写检查词库里居然没有flatshare和flatmate这两个单词</li>
<li>Come on, who would want me for a flatmate?</li>
<li>You're the second person to say that to me today.</li>
<li>Who is the first?</li>
<li>How fresh?</li>
<li>Just in, sixty, natural cases.</li>
<li>Used to work here. I knew him, he was nice.</li>
<li>Fine, we'll start with the <strong>riding crop(马鞭）</strong>.</li>
<li>So, bad day was it?</li>
<li>I need to know the <strong>bruises(伤痕）</strong> form in the next 20 minutes.</li>
<li>A man's <strong>alibi(不在场证明)</strong> depends on it. Text me.</li>
<li>Listen, I was wondering. Maybe later, when you finished.</li>
<li>You weren't wearing lipstick before.</li>
<li>I refreshed it a bit.</li>
<li>Sorry, you were saying?</li>
<li>I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee?</li>
<li>Black, two sugars, please. I'll be upstairs.</li>
<li>Ok.</li>
</ol>
<p>(福华初见时刻)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Bit different from my day（物是人非）</strong>.</li>
<li>You’ve no idea.</li>
<li>Mike, can I borrow your phone? There's no signal on mine.</li>
<li>What's wrong with the <strong>landline（座机）</strong>?</li>
<li>I prefer to text.</li>
<li>Sorry, it's in my coat.</li>
<li>Oh, here. Use mine.</li>
<li>Oh, thank you.</li>
<li>This is an old friend of mine, John Watson.</li>
<li>Afghanistan or Iraq.</li>
<li>Sorry?</li>
<li>Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq.</li>
<li>Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you know it?</li>
<li>What happen to the lipstick.</li>
<li>It wasn't working for me.</li>
<li>Really, I think it was a big improvement. Your mouth is too small now.</li>
<li>How do feel about the violin?</li>
<li>Sorry, what?</li>
<li>I play the violin when I'm thinking sometimes.</li>
<li>I don't talk for days <strong>on end(连续地)</strong>. Would that bother you?</li>
<li>Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.</li>
<li>Have you told him about me?</li>
<li>Not a word.</li>
<li>Who said about the flatmates?</li>
<li>I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.</li>
<li>Now, here he is, just after lunch, with an old friend.</li>
<li>Clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Wasn't a difficult leap.</li>
<li>How did you know about Afghanistan?</li>
<li>Got me eye on a nice place in central London. We ought to be afford it.</li>
<li>We'll meet there at seven o'clock tomorrow evening.</li>
<li>Sorry, <strong>got to dash(赶时间)</strong>.</li>
<li>I think I left my riding crop in the <strong>mortuary(停尸间)</strong>.</li>
<li>Is that it?</li>
<li>Is that what?</li>
<li>We've just met and we're going to go and look at a flat.</li>
<li>Problem?</li>
<li>We don't know a thing about each other.</li>
<li>I don't know where we're meeting and even your name.</li>
<li>I know you are an army doctor and you've been invalided from Afghanistan. You've got a brother worried about you. But you won't go to him for help because you don't approve of him, possibly he is an alcoholic, more likely because he recently worked out his wife. And I know your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid.（说话不带喘气的卷福🤦‍）</li>
<li>That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?</li>
<li><strong>The name is Sherlock Holms, and the address is 221B Baker Street.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>（梦开始的地方）</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hello</li>
<li>Mr. Holmes.</li>
<li>Sherlock, please.</li>
<li>Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive.</li>
<li>Mrs Hudson,the landlady. She's given me a special deal. Owes me a favor.</li>
<li>A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out.</li>
<li>Sorry, you stopped him being executed?</li>
<li>Oh, no. I'm ensured it.</li>
<li>Oh, this could be very nice. Very nice indeed.</li>
<li>Yes, I think so, my thoughts <strong>precisely(正是）</strong>.</li>
<li>Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out.</li>
<li>Well, obviouly I can emm... straighten things up a bit.</li>
<li>That's a skull.</li>
<li>Friend of mine. When I say friend...</li>
<li>What do you think, then, Dr Waston?</li>
<li>There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing twoo bedrooms.</li>
<li>Of course we'll be needing two.</li>
<li>Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts round here.</li>
<li>Mrs Turner next door's got married ones.</li>
<li>Sherlock, the miss you've made.</li>
<li>I looked you up on the internet last night.</li>
<li>Anything interesting?</li>
<li>I've find you website. The science of deduction.</li>
<li>What did you think?</li>
<li>You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airlane pilot by his left thumb?</li>
<li>Yes. And I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your old brother's drinking habits on your new mobile phone.</li>
<li>How?</li>
<li>What about these suicides then, Sherlock?</li>
<li>I thought that'd be <strong>right up your street</strong>(合你的胃口). Three, exactly the same.</li>
<li>Four, there's been the fourth. There's something different this time.</li>
<li>Where?</li>
<li>Brixton</li>
<li>What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to me otherwise there was something different.</li>
<li>You know how they never leave notes?</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>This one did.</li>
<li>Will you come?</li>
<li>Who is on forensics(取证)?</li>
<li>Anderson.</li>
<li>Anderson won't work well with me.</li>
<li>Well, he won't be your assistant.</li>
<li>I need an assistant.</li>
<li>Will you come?</li>
<li>Not in a police car, I'll be right behind.</li>
<li>Thank you.</li>
<li>Brilliant! Yes!</li>
<li>Four serial suicides, and now a note. Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs Hudson, I'll be late. Might need some food.</li>
<li>I'm your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper.</li>
<li>Something cold will do. John, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home. Don't wait up.</li>
<li>Look at him, dashing out.</li>
<li>My husband was just the same.</li>
<li>But you're more the sitting-down type, I can tell.</li>
<li>I'll make you the <strong>cuppa( = a cup of tea)</strong>, you rest your leg.</li>
<li>Damn my leg. Sorry, I'm so sorry. It's just sometimes this bloody thing...</li>
<li>I understand, dear. I've got a hip.</li>
<li>Cup of tea would be lovely. Thank you.</li>
<li>Just this once, dear. I'm not your housekeeper.</li>
<li>Couple of biscuits too, if you've got them.</li>
<li>Not your housekeeper.</li>
<li>You're a doctor. In fact you're an army doctor.</li>
<li>Any good?</li>
<li>Very good.</li>
<li>Seen a lot of injures, then, violent deaths.</li>
<li>Bit of trouble too, I bet?</li>
<li>Of course. Yes. Enough for a lifetime, far too much.</li>
<li>Want to see some more?</li>
<li>Oh, god. Yes.</li>
<li>Sorry, I'll skip the tea. Off out.</li>
<li>Both of you?</li>
<li>Impossible suiciedes. Four of them. No point sitting at home when there's something fun going on.</li>
<li>Look at you, all happy. It's not decent.</li>
<li>Who cares about the decent?</li>
<li>The game, Mrs. Hudson, is on!</li>
